Welsh Pharmacy Android App

This app was created as part of a team coursework. It's origin was to determine whether the idea surrounding the purpose of the application was viable and worth future investment. 

The application uses mocked data, as was the expectation due to a 4-week time limit on the entirety of the project, and connects users directly to Pharmacies via Pharmacists.
